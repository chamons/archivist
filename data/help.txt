Welcome to The Archivist.

In this coffee break roguelike, you are a member of a secret society exploring long forgotten 
and dead corners of the world for new words, new rules of grammar of "true language".

Known by many names:
- The uncreated word
- The primal tongue
- The echoes of creation
- True language 

The right word, in the right tone, in the right context, with the right emotional state, 
and powered by sufficient will can bend reality in this world. Often this knowledge was 
horded until death, libraries burned, and such power passed back into myth.

You are sent on missions to areas filled with hostile creatures in search of a runestone.
Each runestone contains a new noun or verb, which improves your equipment between missions.

​After collecting all six runes you will complete the grand archive and ​win the game.

Skills:
- Skill can be powered one of three ways:
   - Some skills consume will (cost show after the skill name), which recharges when you rest
   - Some skills have a limited number of changes per mission (but always recharge between missions)
   - Some skills have a time based cooldown

Hints:
- There is no reward for killing enemies, so get the runestone and get out
- Resting with no enemies visible will restore Health and Will
- Intelligent enemies will track you to your last visible location, 
use that to separate larger groups of enemies.
- Mouse over enemies to get more information about them
- If you are having difficulty, consider enabling the Easy difficulty in options.
