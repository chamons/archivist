# The Archivist

This is my in work submission to the [roguetemple's Fortnight](https://itch.io/jam/roguetemples-fortnight) gamejam.

Some of the code is based upon the [Hands-on Rust book](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/).

## Known Bugs

Existing the application on macOS with CMD+Q will _not_ save your game due to what is believed to be a Macroquad or Miniquad bug. 

Make sure to exit either by clicking the close button or Shift + Q.


## Art

Art is from the "Classic Roguelike" arts set on [Oryx Design Lab](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/). 

It is _not_ included in the open source release due to license constraints.
